# TDP 3 : Fox Multiplication

## Compilation

We assume that you're located at the root of the project, named tdp3-honorat

- On plafrim, just run ```./buildPlafrim```
- On your PC, you can do :
  ```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  ```
Some warnings may appear on plafrim, due to the MPI version.

## Binaries

- main [-a <matrix_file_path> -b <matrix_file_path>] [-o <matrix_output_path] [-c <check_matrix_file_path>]
- test [<mat_size>] 
  => visual checking for gather/scatter, comparison with blas
- bench <mat_size> <nb_iter> 
  => produces output %mat_size %time_execution(ms)
  <nb_iter> will allow to compute a mean of several execution times

## Graphs

After compilation on Plafrim, you can compute several graphs by running ```./createGraph.sh```
We assume the project is located in your $HOME.
